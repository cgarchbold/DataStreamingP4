# Implementation of Single-Flow Spread Sketches
This project implements three different single-flow spread sketches in different scripts in python.

A bitmap, a probabilistic bitmap, and a HyperLogLog(HLL) Sketch

# Dependencies

python - math,random

# Running
To run each:

The scripts contain main functions which instantiate the demo parameters.

```
    python bitmap.py
    python prob_bitmap.py
    python hll.py
```
The resulting outputs will be written to their respective files, labeled by filter type.
